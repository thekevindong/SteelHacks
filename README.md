Campus Capacity & Accessibility Dashboard
This project aims to improve the experience of students, staff, and visitors at the University of Pittsburgh by providing real-time insights into how full different campus buildings are. Using data from sources such as 25Live and the Pitt CSC API, the system will estimate occupancy levels based on class schedules, events, and building data.
